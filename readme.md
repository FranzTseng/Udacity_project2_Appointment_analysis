# No-Show Appointment dataset
## by Franz Tseng


## Dataset

> This dataset has 100K apponitment data with a variety of features. And the focus of this project is to analyze these features to find out which feature can best predict whether the patient showed up or not. The dependent variable(target) is the "No_show" column which indicates if the appointment is "No show".


## Summary of Findings

> - There is a trend client booked long ago is more likely to not show up.
> - From the analysis, gender does not affect whether client visit or not, but age does.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> The single most important feature that can strongly predict show/no show is whether the client booked on the same day as the actualy visit. If the client booked an apponitment exactly on the same day, it is very likely the client showed up.
